Marc is a PhD student in at the Institute of Computer Science at Nijmegen, where he is currently researching the use of computer-verified proofs on concurrent programs.
He is originally from Luxembourg and earned a Bachelor's degree in Physics in Germany. During his Master's program, Marc became captivated by the use of computers to verify mathematical proofs, leading him to switch fields to Mathematics and explore this further in his Master Thesis.

In his free time, he enjoys scaling the heights of the local climbing gym, watching movies/shows or cooking with friends, listening to music and reading.
