From January 15 to 21 POPL will be held in Boston this year, and the Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is again being held in conjunction with it. 
I have a received a scholarship allowing me to participate this year, and I will also be attending POPL, helping out as a student volunteer.
