Originally I'm from Luxembourg and earned my Bachelor’s degree in Physics in Germany. During my Master’s program, I became very captivated by the use of computers to verify mathematical proofs, leading me to switch fields to Math in order to explore this further in my Master Thesis.

While this makes me a mathematician by training, I’m arguably more of a logician by practice. As you can see below, I have done some work on the intersection of computer-verified mathematics, first-order arithmetic and computability theory, in particular making use of an approach coined synthetic computability.

I am currently looking for a PhD position in the area of mathematical logic, interested in continuing research on **mechanized mathematics**, topics like **paraconsistent logics**, the boundaries of the **incompleteness theorems**, or combinations of these themes.

If you are interested or have any pointers for me in this regard, please feel free to reach out!
